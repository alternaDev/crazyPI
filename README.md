#CRAZY-PI
##What the hell is this?
Crazy-pi trys to calculate π. But the server won't have to calculate *anything*, because the work will be put on clients. These Clients are simple WebBrowsers! That means that theoretically everyone could help calculate π, because everyone has a WebBrowser. And if everyone uses CrazyPi, we will be able to calculate a large amount of digits in a pretty fast time. The only limit is the HDD of the server. This hasn't been tested with really many digits (my local max was around 1000) so I don't know how much storage it'll use.
